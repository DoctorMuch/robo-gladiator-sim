# robo-gladiator-sim
An MVP for the Con Solo Game Jam

## The Robo-Gladiator Sim is a graphic-free battle game that allows players to compete against a computer opponent. 

* Players start with a set health and maximum attack power.
* Players have the option to fight or skip battles, but if a player skips a battle, they lose money.
* Each game consists of three rounds, and the score is calculated according to a player's money at the end of the third round (if they survive all three rounds!)
* Players can use the money they earn in battles to refill their health or upgrade their attack, inflicting more damage on the enemy-robots.
